# Deface-Model

Deface template to use, modify and distribute freely.

This repository is just a deface model, made to be downloaded, modified and shared freely according to each person's wishes. We are not responsible for the misuse of this repository nor for the misuse of the files present here.

We try our best to keep as much information as possible within a single file, be it CSS or JS code, everything must be kept in the same file, so that in this way, the deface can be used through a single and independent file.

The same goes for image and favicon files, we recommend that you change the source code to reference the images through an external link, and not through local files.
